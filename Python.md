<h2>Create virtual environment</h2>

Create a virtual environment within the project directory by typing:
<ul>
<li>
virtualenv newenv
</li>
</ul>

To install packages into the isolated environment, you must activate it by typing:

<ul>
<li>
source newenv/bin/activate
</li>
</ul>

To leave your virtual environment, you need to issue the deactivate command from anywhere on the system:

<ul>
<li>
deactivate
</li>
</ul>
